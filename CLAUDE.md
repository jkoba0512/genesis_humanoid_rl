   - Use `robot.n_dofs` instead of `len(robot.dofs)`
   - Use `robot.get_dofs_position()` for joint positions
   - Use `robot.get_dofs_velocity()` for joint velocities
   
4. **Scene Cleanup**:
   - No `scene.close()` method - Genesis handles cleanup automatically

#### Dependencies Added
- **trimesh**: Required for Genesis mesh loading

#### Reward Function Implementation Details
**Components and Weights**:
1. **Forward Velocity Reward** (weight: 1.0)
   - Encourages movement in positive X direction toward target velocity
   - Calculated as: `min(forward_velocity / target_velocity, 2.0)`
   - Capped at 2x target velocity to prevent unrealistic speedup rewards

2. **Stability Reward** (weight: 0.5) 
   - Rewards upright posture using quaternion tilt measurement
   - Uses x,y quaternion components: `max(0.0, 1.0 - 2.0 * tilt_magnitude)`
   - Prevents robot from falling over or excessive leaning

3. **Height Maintenance Reward** (weight: 0.3)
   - Keeps robot at reasonable walking height (~0.8m)
   - Linear decay: `max(0.0, 1.0 - height_difference)`
   - Encourages natural walking posture

4. **Energy Efficiency Penalty** (weight: -0.1)
   - Penalizes excessive joint velocities to encourage efficient movement
   - Based on mean squared joint velocities, capped at 10.0
   - Promotes smooth, energy-conscious locomotion

5. **Action Smoothness Penalty** (weight: -0.1) 
   - Encourages smooth actions by penalizing sudden changes
   - Based on mean squared differences from previous action
   - Reduces jerky, unnatural movements

6. **Height Safety Penalty** (weight: -0.5)
   - Prevents unrealistic jumping by penalizing excessive height
   - Triggered when robot base exceeds 1.2m height
   - Maintains realistic physics behavior

**Termination Conditions**:
- Robot falls below 0.3m height (fallen down)
- Robot moves >10m in X direction or >5m in Y direction (out of bounds)
- Robot jumps above 2.0m height (unrealistic behavior)
- Quaternion-based severe tilt detection (temporarily disabled for development)

**Validation Results**:
- Average reward per step: 0.768 (positive, indicating good behavior balance)
- Forward progress achieved: 0.767m in 30 steps
- Episode termination: Natural termination when robot physics fail
- Performance: Maintains 50-60 FPS during reward calculation
