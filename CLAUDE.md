   - Use `robot.n_dofs` instead of `len(robot.dofs)`
   - Use `robot.get_dofs_position()` for joint positions
   - Use `robot.get_dofs_velocity()` for joint velocities
   
4. **Scene Cleanup**:
   - No `scene.close()` method - Genesis handles cleanup automatically

#### Dependencies Added
- **trimesh**: Required for Genesis mesh loading

#### Reward Function Implementation Details
**Components and Weights**:
1. **Forward Velocity Reward** (weight: 1.0)
   - Encourages movement in positive X direction toward target velocity
   - Calculated as: `min(forward_velocity / target_velocity, 2.0)`
   - Capped at 2x target velocity to prevent unrealistic speedup rewards

2. **Stability Reward** (weight: 0.5) 
   - Rewards upright posture using quaternion tilt measurement
   - Uses x,y quaternion components: `max(0.0, 1.0 - 2.0 * tilt_magnitude)`
   - Prevents robot from falling over or excessive leaning

3. **Height Maintenance Reward** (weight: 0.3)
   - Keeps robot at reasonable walking height (~0.8m)
   - Linear decay: `max(0.0, 1.0 - height_difference)`
   - Encourages natural walking posture

4. **Energy Efficiency Penalty** (weight: -0.1)
   - Penalizes excessive joint velocities to encourage efficient movement
   - Based on mean squared joint velocities, capped at 10.0
   - Promotes smooth, energy-conscious locomotion

5. **Action Smoothness Penalty** (weight: -0.1) 
   - Encourages smooth actions by penalizing sudden changes
   - Based on mean squared differences from previous action
   - Reduces jerky, unnatural movements

6. **Height Safety Penalty** (weight: -0.5)
   - Prevents unrealistic jumping by penalizing excessive height
   - Triggered when robot base exceeds 1.2m height
   - Maintains realistic physics behavior

**Termination Conditions**:
- Robot falls below 0.3m height (fallen down)
- Robot moves >10m in X direction or >5m in Y direction (out of bounds)
- Robot jumps above 2.0m height (unrealistic behavior)
- Quaternion-based severe tilt detection (temporarily disabled for development)

**Validation Results**:
- Average reward per step: 0.768 (positive, indicating good behavior balance)
- Forward progress achieved: 0.767m in 30 steps
- Episode termination: Natural termination when robot physics fail
- Performance: Maintains 50-60 FPS during reward calculation

## Phase 11: Training Execution and Monitoring (In Progress)
**Objective**: Execute curriculum learning training with real-time monitoring

**Current Training Status**:
- ✅ **Medium Curriculum Training**: Successfully started 100k step training with `configs/curriculum_medium.json`
- ✅ **TensorBoard Integration**: Installed and configured for real-time progress monitoring
- ✅ **Background Training**: Training running in background (87+ minutes, high CPU utilization)
- 🔄 **Progress Monitoring**: TensorBoard logging in progress, waiting for first rollout completion

**Training Infrastructure**:
1. **Execution Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Background training execution
   nohup uv run python scripts/train_curriculum.py --config configs/curriculum_medium.json > training_medium.log 2>&1 &
   
   # Real-time monitoring
   uv run tensorboard --logdir ./logs/curriculum_medium --port 6006
   ```

2. **TensorBoard Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Install TensorBoard with uv
   uv add tensorboard
   
   # Verify installation
   uv run tensorboard --version
   ```

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - **Log Directory**: `./logs/curriculum_medium/`
   - **TensorBoard URL**: http://localhost:6006
   - **Refresh Interval**: Automatic updates with `--reload_interval 10`

- **Training Performance**: High CPU utilization (218% on multi-core system) indicates active learning
- **Log File Size**: Initial small file size (88 bytes) expected until first logging event
- **Background Process Management**: Training continues reliably in background with nohup

- **Training Process**: Active (PID 682754, 87+ minutes runtime)
- **CPU Usage**: 218% (indicating intensive computation)
- **Memory Usage**: 20.8GB (large model and environment overhead)
- **Log Status**: Waiting for first rollout completion to begin TensorBoard data flow

**Next Steps**:
- Continue monitoring TensorBoard for first data appearance
- Wait for curriculum stage progression notifications
- Evaluate training results after completion
- Compare curriculum vs standard training outcomes

**Expected Training Progression**:
1. **Balance Stage**: Episodes ~100-200 steps, rewards ~0.3-0.5
2. **Small Steps Stage**: Episodes ~150-250 steps, rewards ~0.6-0.8  
3. **Walking Stage**: Episodes ~300+ steps, rewards ~0.8-1.2
4. **Advanced Stages**: Complex behaviors with higher rewards

This phase demonstrates the practical execution of the complete curriculum learning system in a production environment.
